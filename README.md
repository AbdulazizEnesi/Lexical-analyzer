This is a simple *Lexical Analyzer* written in the C programming language. It performs *lexical analysis* on input source code, breaking it into tokens such as keywords, identifiers, numbers, operators, and symbols.

This lexical analyzer can identify:
- âœ… *Keywords*: int, float, if, else, while, return, etc.
- âœ… *Identifiers*: Variable names like score, total

- âœ… *Symbols*: ;, (, ), {, }
- âœ… *Single-line Comments*: // comment here

- Enter your code input and end with a $ symbol
- The analyzer scans input *character by character*
- It classifies each lexeme into its correct *token type*
